                      In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information

                    <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
                    <p>
                      Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. 
                      Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, 
                      as well as to provide reporting information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, JET SETTERS) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set 
                      by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party 
                      features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). 
                      The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question 
                      and also when it visits certain other websites.

                    <p>
                      We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons 
                      in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. 
                      Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our 
                      Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. 
                      This is described in more detail below.

                      You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting 
                      your preferences in the Cookie Consent Tool we provide on our Website. The Cookie Consent Tool allows you to select 
                      which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary 
                      to provide you with services.

                      As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you 
                      should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
